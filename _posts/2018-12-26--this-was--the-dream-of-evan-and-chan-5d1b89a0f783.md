Going back to New York for the holidays is always bizarre because people
expect for the city to be always-on and on-demand, but it's really a ghost
town of lonely randos huddled in Irish pubs. I always feel like I'm back in
high school, that sense of self-imposed alienation returning to me in waves of
nostalgic something or the other.

I've been playing this song on repeat for that feeling and because of that
feeling. The static gets louder as the feedback loop of analog transition
snowballs around itself. It is remarkably high school. I remember putting it
on a mixtape and handing it over to a crush, exclaiming that this is the
original Postal Service song. I'm still a fucking know-it-all but to make that
supposed authentic claim then made me cement indie-emo kid into my identity: I
knew about it first. Even the band's origin story -- editing tracks across
snail mail -- has 2002/2003 written all over it. Eventually, USPS actually
sued them for using the trademark, and in classic indie fashion, they sold
tracks that were played in the background of commercials with whiteboards in
it and did a live performance at its annual National Executive Conference.
