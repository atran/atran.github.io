For what it's worth, I started writing about PG&E a week ago, before the Kincade fire â€“ a recurring theme in these end times is how the urgency of disasters outpaces our ability to comprehend it. But, really, this is another tragic story in the ever-perpetual saga of corporate interests over individuals that literally pollute and incinerate our environment. It's inevitable: climate change is straight up going to kill us soon. It's especially accelerated and cruel, though, because privatized interests make us feel like its our fault (see: plastic straws) while leaving us literally and figuartively powerless, all the while the state continues to bail them out. 

PG&E, the investor-owned utility which provides most power to most of California, is the cause of these wildfires (even if this will not be substantiated anytime soon, trust me, they are). They've always been fucked up. Remember the movie _Erin Brockovich_ (2000) that scored Julia Roberts with an Oscar? PG&E was that very corporation that polluted that town's water, starting in 1952. This eventually resulted in a paid settlement... in 1996, 44 years after the initial poisoning. Even to this day, the contaimination is still spreading. Th

But let's get back to the present. PG&E was found liable for many of the major wildfires in 2017-2018 with damages totaling over $30B. This impossible sum led to forcing California to pass legislation that let the utility pass off some of the cost to customers by raising rates. And soon thereafter, PG&E declared bankruptcy, effectively giving it another lifeline. This allowed them renegotiate their clean energy contracts, handicapping them, which will likely get in the way of California's 2013 goal of 50% renewable energy.

All this background is necessary to understand that, right before these recent fires, PG&E decided to shutoff power to about 3 million people, as a supposed precaution to reduce these very wildfires. When notifying people of this shutoff, PG&E's website crashed attributed to "glitches", all the while when top execs of the company were wining-and-dining in a private Sonoma vineyard. Nonetheless, the sparks from their ill-installed power lines still caused devasting and still ongoing fires across California. PG&E's passive-aggressive blackout  arises from their game of risk calculations of profit. The blackouts actually make it harder to measure the physical impacts of these disasters, as it has disabled at least 6 air quality monitoring stations.

Private profit and private risk
