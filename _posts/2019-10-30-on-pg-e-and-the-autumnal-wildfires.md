For what it's worth, I started writing about PG&E a week ago, before the Kincade fire â€“ a recurring theme in these end times is how the urgency of disasters outpaces our ability to comprehend it. But, really, this is another tragic story in the ever-perpetual saga of corporate interests over individuals that literally pollute and incinerate our environment. It's inevitable: climate change is straight up going to kill us soon. It's especially accelerated and cruel, though, because privatized interests make us feel like its our fault (see: plastic straws) while leaving us literally and figuartively powerless, all the while the state continues to bail them out. 

PG&E, the investor-owned utility which provides most power to most of California, is the cause of these wildfires (even if this will not be substantiated anytime soon, trust me, they are). They've always been fucked up. Remember the movie _Erin Brockovich_ (2000) that scored Julia Roberts with an Oscar? PG&E was that very corporation that polluted that town's water, starting in 1952. This eventually resulted in a paid settlement... in 1996, 44 years after the initial poisoning. Even to this day, the contaimination is still spreading. Th

But let's get back to the present. PG&E was found liable for a lot of the major wildfires in 2017-2018, damages totaling over $30B. This impossible sum led to forcing California pass legistlation that let the utility pass off some of the liability to customers by raising rates. But then, PG&E declared bankrupcy, effectively giving it another lifeline.
