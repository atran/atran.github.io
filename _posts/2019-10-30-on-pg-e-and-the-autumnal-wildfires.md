For what it's worth, I started writing about [PG&E's rolling blackouts a week ago](https://www.npr.org/2019/10/23/772854265/pg-e-imposes-new-power-shutoffs-in-parts-of-northern-california-to-avert-wildfir?t=1571926633124), before the [Kincade fire](https://www.latimes.com/wildfires-map/) – a recurring theme in these end times is how the urgency of disasters outpaces our ability to comprehend it. But, really, this is another tragic story in the ever-perpetual saga of corporate interests over individuals that literally pollute and incinerate our environment. It's certain: [climate change is straight up going to kill us soon](https://www.instagram.com/extinctionrebellion/). Although I prefer it to be [as graceful as possible](https://www.politis.fr/articles/2019/09/effondrement-en-cours-on-fait-quoi-40822/), it's especially accelerated and cruel, because privatized interests make us feel like its our fault (see: plastic straws), leaving us literally and figuratively powerless, all the while the state continues to bail them out.

PG&E, the investor-owned utility which provides most power to most of California, is the cause of these wildfires (even if this will not be substantiated anytime soon, trust me, they are). They've always been fucked up. Remember the movie _Erin Brockovich_ (2000) that scored Julia Roberts with an Oscar? PG&E was that very corporation that polluted that town's water. They were also found liable for many of the major wildfires in 2017-2018 with damages totaling over $30B. They[ passed off half of this cost to customers by raising rates](https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2019-07-25/california-utilities-agree-to-pay-10-5-billion-into-new-wildfire-fund). And soon thereafter, PG&E declared bankruptcy, effectively giving it another lifeline which let them handicap renewable energy contracts. This evil sustains itself by extinguishing new forms of competition.

But let's get back to the present: right before these recent fires, [PG&E decided to shutoff power to about 3 million people](https://www.city-journal.org/planned-electricity-blackouts-california?), as a supposed precaution to reduce these very wildfires with a boardroom-friendly label of "public safety power shutoff" (PSPS) events. When notifying people of this shutoff, [PG&E's website crashed attributed to "glitches"](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/12/business/pge-california-outage.html), all the while when top execs of the company were wining-and-dining in a private Sonoma vineyard. Nonetheless, the sparks from their ill-installed power lines still caused devasting and still ongoing fires across California. PG&E's passive-aggressive blackout arises from their game of risk calculations of profit: it probably cost less for them to do that to people than actually enact a real plan. The blackouts actually make it harder to measure the physical impacts of these disasters, [as it has disabled at least 6 air quality monitoring stations](https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/bjwa7v/pgandes-blackouts-are-making-it-harder-to-measure-the-toxic-stew-in-the-air-from-californias-wildfires). PG&E [created a disaster to conceal the effects of their other disaster](https://slate.com/business/2019/10/california-power-outage-pge-fires-new-kind-of-disaster.html), just like Trump withdrew troops as he is gets closer impeached: simple hand waving distractions that cause their own shocks and overlapping ripples.

The wildfires and blackouts are not inevitable and are the result of a utility that prefers returns for its shareholders (even when it's at $7, down from $70 just 3 years ago lol) over the public safety. They balance their spreadsheets and come to the conclusion that it isn't profitable to replace bad, extraneous infrastructure and resist transitions to more local and cleaner energy. PG&E imports their energy from hundreds of miles away on shoddy lines because, like all monopolies, prefer to maintain their old ways as a state of confusion which bears exhaustion on all of us. The dominant institutions of our time gaslight us.

There are [alternative models](https://www.vox.com/energy-and-environment/2019/10/22/20916820/california-wildfire-climate-change-blackout-insurance-pge): one being [decentralized systems](https://www.vox.com/energy-and-environment/2019/10/28/20926446/california-grid-distributed-energy) that are [owned and operated by the public](https://www.thenation.com/article/wildfires-california-pge/) It's not perfect, but it provides more checks and balances than the private model. In formulating a world where we can still exist, we must combine our ecology with our economy and privilege sustainability in what we value. Stop bailing out the shitty corporations!

Our problems seem to sometimes feel like they only exist online, images with their re-posts & comments streaming from our feeds, the digital furthering the distance of the most pressing issues surrounding us. But we still live in a very elemental world: electricity and fire are some of the most basic materials. The dangerous interplay of private profit over public risk that still pervades our world must be rethought. I don't care if you use plastic straws; we should instead be using that guilt to advocate for bigger ideas of our economy and its corporate structures. Humans have always shaped the elements and it is time to re-configure them to benefit the public good.
